                Happy Birthday to the love of my life! 💕 You make every day brighter just by being you, and I’m so grateful to have you by my side. Today, I celebrate you—your kindness, your beauty, your strength, and everything that makes you so special. May this year bring you endless happiness, success, and all your dreams coming true. I’ll always be here to love and support you in everything you do. You mean the world to me, and I love you more than words can say. 🎂🎉🎁
